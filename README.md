# Localized orthogonal decomposition for strongly damped wave

## Installing dependencies
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install most of the dependencies.

The one exception is the `scikit-sparse` package, which was broken when this was tested.

This needs to be installed with `pip install scikit-sparse`.

`scikit-sparse` additionally requires `libsuitesparse-dev` to be installed. You can do this by running:

```sudo apt install libsuitesparse-dev```
